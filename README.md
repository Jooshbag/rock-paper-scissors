#Rock, Paper, Scissors!

    A browser-based game of rock, paper, scissors against an A.I.


##General info

This is my first solo project to help learn Javascript. Originally was only playable in console, but have added a UI to the game as I learned more CSS. It's a simple game that gets the player's choice from button input, and randomly picks the computer's choice. It keeps track of scores, and shows each choice.


##Technologies
